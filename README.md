# Nucleo Count - DNA Nucleotide Counter

The Nucleo Count is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to input a DNA sequence and obtain a count of each type of nucleotide (A, T, G, C) present in the sequence. The app provides visualizations and a DataFrame for better data representation.

## Features
- **DNA Sequence Input**: Allows users to input a DNA sequence.
- **Nucleotide Counting**: Counts the number of adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) nucleotides in the input DNA sequence.
- **Output Display**: 
  - Textual display of nucleotide counts.
  - DataFrame display of nucleotide counts.
  - Bar chart visualization of nucleotide counts using Altair.
